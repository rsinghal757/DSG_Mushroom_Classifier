# Predicting mushroom samples as edible or poisonous.

The aim of this project was to classify mushroom samples into two classes: edible and poisonous, using characteristics like odor, gill size, color etc. A dataset taken from Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms(1981) is used for the purpose.

R (version 3.4.2) was used to create a model to classify the mushroom samples as edible or poisonous.
